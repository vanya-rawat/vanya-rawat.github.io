Hello Everyone!

For our first photography assignment we went to Dr. Bahu Daji Lad Museum in Byculla.
It is the oldest museum in Mumbai and was originally established as a treasure house of industrial and decorative arts.
It is built in Renaissance style and as originally named Victoria and Albert Museum.

Our assignment brief was to capture the interior and exterior of the museum, along with the artefacts on display.
We had to keep in mind that our photographs could be used for a mock assignment such as a museum brochure/invitation card design.
