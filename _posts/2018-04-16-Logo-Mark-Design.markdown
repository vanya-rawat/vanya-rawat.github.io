Hello Everyone!

This is an assignment I did for Typography II.
The assignment brief was to create a logo type using relevant typeface to create a visual identity for the brand assigned. We were supposed to cascade the logomark on stationary items - business cards, letterheads, and envelopes. We also has to craft an app icon for it. The final deliverable has to be as mockups.

The brand assigned to me was Sony.

I can add the steps I took to reach here if you guys want to see it. Let me know in the comments section below.
