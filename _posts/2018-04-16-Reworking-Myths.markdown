Hello Everyone!

This is an assignment I did for Cultural Narratives
The assignment brief was to pick a character from mythology or a comic book superhero. We had to rework the imagery of the chosen character and make it more relevant to 2018. We were also supposed to use a skill from another class in this assignment.

I don't want to bore you guys so I won't attach my 500 word essay on my character but if many people want to read it, I'll be open to uploading it. Let me know in the comments section below!

I chose Hades as my character and to give this old Greek God a modern twist, I reimagined him as a young business tycoon who owns a successful casino in Las Vegas. He lives in the age of social media and growing fashion industry. His look is modern, gothic chic. Very rich kids of instagram.
