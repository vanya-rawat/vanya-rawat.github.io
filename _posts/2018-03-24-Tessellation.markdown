tessellation
ˌtɛsəˈleɪʃ(ə)n/Submit
noun
the process or art of tessellating a surface, or the state of being tessellated.
an arrangement of shapes closely fitted together, especially of polygons in a repeated pattern without gaps or overlapping.

For my 1st Assignment of semester 1 we had to make a tessellation. We had to cut random shapes in paper and see a shape in it.
